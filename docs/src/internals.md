# For developers

Writing code that supports OffsetArrays is generally fairly straightforward.
The majority of cases can be handled with these tips:

- replace many uses of `size` with `axes`
- replace `1:length(A)` with `eachindex(A)`, or if you need an integer index with `LinearIndices(A)`
- replace explicit allocations like `Array{Int}(undef, size(B))` with `similar(Array{Int}, axes(B))`

More information can be found in [Julia's developer documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/offset-arrays/).
The most subtle issues tend to arise around the axes, and further detail specific to
OffsetArrays.jl follows below.

## Internals

How does OffsetArrays work? The fundamental principle is very simple:
an `OffsetArray` is just a wrapper around a "parent" array, together
with an index offset:

```jldoctest oa; setup=:(using OffsetArrays)
julia> oa = OffsetArray([1 2; 3 4], 0:1, 5:6)
2×2 OffsetArray(::Matrix{Int64}, 0:1, 5:6) with eltype Int64 with indices 0:1×5:6:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> parent(oa)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> oa.offsets
(-1, 4)
```

So `parent(oa)` is the original array we constructed it with, and `oa.offsets` is a tuple,
each entry encoding the index-shift to be applied along the corresponding axis.
When you index `oa[i,j]`, it "translates" the `i,j` indexes back to the parent array's
indexes and then returns the value in the parent.

## The axes of OffsetArrays

The internal of offset computing is achieved by [`IdOffsetRange`](@ref OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange)
type:

```jldoctest oa
julia> ax = axes(oa, 2)
OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(5:6)
```

This has a similar design to `Base.IdentityUnitRange` that `ax[x] == x` always holds.

```jldoctest oa
julia> ax[5]
5
julia> ax[1]
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-element Base.OneTo{Int64} at index [-3]
[...]
```

This property makes sure that they tend to be their own axes:

```jldoctest oa
julia> axes(ax)
(OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(5:6),)

julia> axes(ax[ax])
(OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(5:6),)
```

This example of indexing is [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).
This is a useful characteristic for ensuring the "fundamental axiom" of generalized indexing,
that `a[ax][i] == a[ax[i]]`:

```jldoctest; setup=:(using OffsetArrays)
julia> oa2 = OffsetArray([5, 10, 15, 20], 0:3)
4-element OffsetArray(::Vector{Int64}, 0:3) with eltype Int64 with indices 0:3:
  5
 10
 15
 20

julia> ax2 = axes(oa2, 1)
OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(0:3)

julia> oa2[2]
15

julia> oa2[ax2][2]
15

julia> oa2[ax2[2]]
15
```

`IdOffsetRange`s apply the offset both to the values and the indices of the range, and otherwise preserve the parent range.

!!! warning

    There are circumstances where constructing a specific type of `IdOffsetRange` cannot be supported without changing the axes of the range (see [`OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange`](@ref).)
    In the future, this package will distinguish between *construction*  and *conversion*:

    - construction (aka, *coercion*) will always succeed, even if it has to change the axes of the result (Examples: `RangeType(rng)`, `typeof(rng1)(rng2)`)
    - conversion will succeed only if it can preserve both the values and the axes (Examples: `convert(RangeType, rng)`, `oftype(rng1, rng2)`)

    While these behave equivalently now (conversion currently performs coercion), developers are encouraged to "future-proof" their code by choosing the behavior appropriate for each usage.

## Caveats

Because `IdOffsetRange` behaves quite differently to the normal `UnitRange` type, there are some
cases that you should be aware of, especially when you are working with multi-dimensional arrays.

One such cases is `getindex`:

```jldoctest getindex; setup = :(using OffsetArrays)
julia> Ao = zeros(-3:3, -3:3); Ao[:] .= 1:49;

julia> Ao[-3:0, :] |> axes # the first dimension does not preserve offsets
(OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(1:4), OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(-3:3))

julia> Ao[-3:0, -3:3] |> axes # neither dimensions preserve offsets
(Base.OneTo(4), Base.OneTo(7))

julia> Ao[axes(Ao)...] |> axes # offsets are preserved
(OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(-3:3), OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(-3:3))

julia> Ao[:] |> axes # This is linear indexing
(Base.OneTo(49),)
```

Note that if you pass a `UnitRange`, the offsets in corresponding dimension will not be preserved.
This might look weird at first, but since it follows the `a[ax][i] == a[ax[i]]` rule, it is not a
bug.

```jldoctest getindex
julia> I = -3:0; # UnitRange always starts at index 1

julia> Ao[I, 0][1] == Ao[I[1], 0]
true

julia> ax = axes(Ao, 1) # ax starts at index -3
OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(-3:3)

julia> Ao[ax, 0][1] == Ao[ax[1], 0]
true
```

## Using custom axis types

While a wide variety of `AbstractUnitRange`s provided by `Base` may be used as indices to construct an `OffsetArray`, at times it might be convenient to define custom types. The `OffsetArray` constructor accepts any type that may be converted to an `AbstractUnitRange`. This proceeds through a two-step process. Let's assume that the constructor called is `OffsetArray(A, indstup)`, where `indstup` is a `Tuple` of indices.

1. At the first step, the constructor calls `to_indices(A, axes(A), indstup)` to lower `indstup` to a `Tuple` of `AbstractUnitRange`s. This step converts --- among other things --- `Colon`s to axis ranges. Custom types may extend `Base.to_indices(A, axes(A), indstup)` with the desired conversion of `indstup` to `Tuple{Vararg{AbstractUnitRange{Int}}}` if this is feasible.

2. At the second step, the result obtained from the previous step treated again to convert it to a `Tuple` of `AbstractUnitRange`s to handle cases where the first step doesn't achieve this. An additional customization option may be specified at this stage: a type may be converted either to a single `AbstractUnitRange{Int}`, or to a `Tuple` of them. A type might specify which of these two behaviours is desired by extending [`OffsetArrays.AxisConversionStyle`](@ref). An example of a type that is acted upon at this stage is `CartesianIndices`, which is converted to a `Tuple` of `AbstractUnitRange`s.

For example, here are a couple of custom type that facilitate zero-based indexing:

```jldoctest; setup = :(using OffsetArrays)
julia> struct ZeroBasedIndexing end

julia> Base.to_indices(A, inds, ::Tuple{ZeroBasedIndexing}) = map(x -> 0:length(x)-1, inds)

julia> a = zeros(3, 3);

julia> oa = OffsetArray(a, ZeroBasedIndexing());

julia> axes(oa)
(OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(0:2), OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(0:2))
```

In this example we had to define the action of `to_indices` as the type `ZeroBasedIndexing` did not have a familiar hierarchy. Things are even simpler if we subtype `AbstractUnitRange`, in which case we need to define `first` and `length` for the custom range to be able to use it as an axis:

```jldoctest; setup = :(using OffsetArrays)
julia> struct ZeroTo <: AbstractUnitRange{Int}
       n :: Int
       ZeroTo(n) = new(n < 0 ? -1 : n)
       end

julia> Base.first(::ZeroTo) = 0

julia> Base.length(r::ZeroTo) = r.n + 1

julia> oa = OffsetArray(zeros(2,2), ZeroTo(1), ZeroTo(1));

julia> axes(oa)
(OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(0:1), OffsetArrays.IdOffsetRange(0:1))
```

Note that zero-based indexing may also be achieved using the pre-defined type [`OffsetArrays.Origin`](@ref).
